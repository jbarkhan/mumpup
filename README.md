In this project we constructed a reusable framework written in R for the purpose of exploring a specific set of data (at this stage the data is not publicly available). The framework consists of a set of functions which perform both pre-processing steps and post-processing data analysis where the aim was to reduce the work required and increase flexibility when exploring the data.

Pre-processing functions perform tasks such as
  clean data by manipulating strings to extract numerical information
  identify, extract, and modify control/non-control observations
  subset based on specified variable names and variables values
  Post-processing functions perform tasks such as
extract numerical data
  apply pre-analysis transformations
  multivariate analysis of variations
  data visualisation

"script_example.R" illustrates how the program is intended to be used
