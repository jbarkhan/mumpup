In this project we constructed a reusable framework written in R for the purpose of exploring a specific set of data (at this stage the data is not publicly available). The framework consists of a set of functions which perform both pre-processing steps and post-processing data analysis where the aim was to reduce the work required and increase flexibility when exploring the data.

"script_example.R" illustrates how the program is intended to be used
